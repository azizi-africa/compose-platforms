# Compose Platforms

## Proxy-enabled open source platforms via Docker-Compose
Configure the `*.env.example` files and rename to `*.env` files

**Note:** Not all `docker-compose.yml` files read from `*.env `files (**TODO**)

## Set up domains pointing to platforms using Nginx-Proxy
Create `proxy` network to containers to be exposed via port `80`/`443`
```
docker network create proxy
```

Run `docker-compose up -d` from the `nginx-proxy` folder and ensure that ports `80` and `443` are bindable.
```
cd nginx-proxy
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose -f # To see added services and HTTP requests log
```

Point domains to your instances and generate SSL certificates with LetsEncrypt by
- Setting env `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` to "subdomain.example.com" or "example.com"
- Setting env `VIRTUAL_PORT` to the exposed port for your app service in the `docker-compose.yml` files
- Setting env `DEFAULT_EMAIL` in the `nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy-letsencrypt` service for your support account

# Contributing
Create a pull request after checking that your setup is ready to go with Docker Compose and nginx-proxy
1. Server services should contain the environment variables `VIRTUAL_HOST`, `VIRTUAL_PORT` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST`
2. Server services in `docker-compose.yml` should belong to `default` and `proxy` if they have other services
3. Other services like databases in `docker-compose.yml` shouldn't be on the network `proxy`
4. Avoid sharing .env files between services; use `postgres.env` or `service.env` where possible
